    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>The scope of our business is, literally, worldwide. We help our customers find the right overseas manufacturing sources for their products, working with highly qualified, ISO-certified suppliers from India, China, Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then MES guides these parts to their final destination, managing each step in the supply chain process, including finishing and assembly operations leading to just-in-time delivery. MES maintains warehouse facilities in Ohio, California, Texas and Mexico. Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, we also have offices in India (Mumbai), China (Ningbo and Shenzhen), Poland and Mexico.
        <br>
        <br>
        We help many North American OEMs by managing the entire outsourced manufacturing process. Our mission is to deliver top-quality components in a timely and efficient manner, so we can reduce our customersâ€™ overhead in as many areas as possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our talented worldwide staff includes six sigma engineers, sourcing experts, quality inspectors and supply chain experts to maintain best-in-class metrics for the work we do.
        <br>
        <br>
        MES operates on a simple, 3-part guiding philosophy:
        <br>
        1. Create win-win solutions for our customers.
        <br>
        2. Create a challenging & exciting work environment for our team.
        <br>
        3. Develop quality suppliers across the globe.
